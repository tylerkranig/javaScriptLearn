Coin Flip
- One smart component keeps track of flips and the coin that was flipped and passes down that 
data to the dumb component
- rand.js handles the randomization of the coin flip and stores the data
- display.js displays the data
    this.setState( st => { // This is the callback version of the set state call, 
    st is the old state, returns the new state
        return {
            currCoin: newCoin,
            nflips: st.nflips + 1,
            nHeads: st.nHeads + (newCoin.side === "heads" ? 1 : 0),
            nTails: st.nTails + (newCoin.side === "tails" ? 1 : 0)
        }
    })

Color Boxes
    Using a stateless component for the boxes 
    One issue with having a stateful parent and a stateless child is that you have 
    to know what box was clicked
